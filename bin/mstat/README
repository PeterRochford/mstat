Report Matlab License Status: mstatPeter A. RochfordSymplectic, LLCprochford@thesymplectic.comwww.thesymplectic.com 28 March 2015 (Version 1.0) Display concurrent Matlab licenses in use on a computer platform in an easily human readable form. DescriptionThe mstat application allows users to easily learn how many concurrent licenses are being used out of the total number available. This is particularly helpful for users when all concurrent licenses are being used and they wish to know who is occupying the licenses.Mstat provides information on both the floating and toolbox licenses, alphabetically lists the users occupying the licenses, the start date, as well as the hours elapsed. Users may also be displayed by longest elapse time using the -t option. There is also a basic help (-h) option. Shown below is sample output from mstat.MATLAB Users (3 used out of 3 issued floating licenses):jsmith	: start Fri	Jan 30 08:44:00 EST 2015 (1371.7 hours)kelliott	: start Wed	Jan 28 10:11:00 EST 2015 (1418.3 hours)zyang	: start Fri	Jan 30 08:52:00 EST 2015 (1371.6 hours)Signal_Toolbox Users (1 used out of 2 issued floating license):Zyang	: start Mon	Feb 02 08:33:00 EST 2015 (1299.9 hours)The mstat application parses output provided by the Flexible License Manager (lmstat) that is provided as part of MathWork's Matlab installation. The license manager must be called using "lmstat -a". (Note: lmstat is Copyright © 1989-2013 Flexera Software LLC.

The Java jar file (mstat.jar) should be portable across any operating system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The Java source code is provided in the event you need to compile the code or wish to add new features. Pease email the author any modified code if bugs are fixed, new features implemented, enhancements made, etc.Mstat has only been tested on platforms running a linux operating system. The application should run on any platform for which the Java code can be built and executed. Please notify the author if you successfully build and run mstat on another platform.Installation:

The mstat application is run via the mstat.sh bash script. The latter can be renamed mstat
and copied to a common directory on the linux system such as /usr/bin.

1) Edit the mstat.sh script so that the MATLABHOME and MSTATHOME environment variables are
   assigned the paths to the Matlab home directory and the directory containing the 
   mstat.jar file, respectively. Note that MATLABHOME is commented out as this environment 
   variable should already be defined for the Matlab user.

2) Put the mstat.sh (or mstat) file in a public location (e.g. /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin), 
   or have users define an alias that points to the script such as that below:

alias mstat="/usr/bin/mstat.sh"

Note that this utility requires access to a java compiler that is included in the user's path. 
The java jar file (mstat.jar) should be portable across any operating system that has a Java 
Virtual Machine (JVM).
